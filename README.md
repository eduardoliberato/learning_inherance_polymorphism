Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

Java Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?
- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
